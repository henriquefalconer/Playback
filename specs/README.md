# Playback Implementation Plans

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Production-Ready Transition
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-07

Design documentation and implementation plans for Playback, a macOS screen recording and timeline playback system.

## Overview

Playback continuously captures screenshots, processes them into video segments, and provides a timeline-based viewer for browsing screen history. The system operates as a fully automated background service with a menu bar interface for control and monitoring.

## Core Architecture

| Spec | Code | Purpose |

| [architecture.md](./architecture.md) | [src/Playback/](../src/Playback/) | System architecture, component communication, file organization |
| [file-structure.md](./file-structure.md) | [src/Playback/Playback/Config/](../src/Playback/Playback/Config/) | Dev vs production structure, path resolution, app bundle organization |
| [configuration.md](./configuration.md) | [src/Playback/Playback/Config/ConfigManager.swift](../src/Playback/Playback/Config/ConfigManager.swift) | Configuration file format, hot-reloading, settings management |

## Recording & Processing

| Spec | Code | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| [recording-service.md](./recording-service.md) | [src/scripts/record_screen.py](../src/scripts/record_screen.py) | Screenshot capture service with 2-second intervals |
| [processing-service.md](./processing-service.md) | [src/scripts/build_chunks_from_temp.py](../src/scripts/build_chunks_from_temp.py) | Video generation, scheduled processing, and cleanup |

## Key Features

- **Continuous Recording**: 2-second screenshot intervals with automatic processing
- **Timeline Viewer**: Arc-inspired design with smooth scrubbing and zoom
- **Date/Time Navigation**: Precise picker for jumping to specific moments
- **Text Search**: OCR-based search to find recorded screen content
- **App Activity Tracking**: Color-coded timeline by frontmost application
- **Resource Monitoring**: Crash notifications with diagnostic information
- **Privacy Controls**: App exclusion and permission management
- **Configurable Retention**: Automatic cleanup based on age and storage limits

## Technical Stack

- **Platform**: macOS 26.0 (Tahoe) or later
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon only (M1, M2, M3, M4+)
- **Languages**: Swift 6.0+, Python 3.12+
- **Dependencies**: FFmpeg 7.0+, SQLite 3.45+
- **Frameworks**: SwiftUI, Vision, AVFoundation, ScreenCaptureKit

## Storage Requirements

- **Typical Usage**: 10-14 GB per month (4-5 hours daily recording)
- **Light Usage**: 6-8 GB per month (2-3 hours daily)
- **Heavy Usage**: 20-28 GB per month (8+ hours daily)
- **Video Segments**: ~7.5 MB per segment (5s video, 5min real-time)
- **Database**: ~2.5 GB per year
- **Recommended**: 100 GB free for 6 months of recordings

## User Interactions

- **Menu Bar Icon**: Toggle recording, access settings, view diagnostics
- **Option + Shift + Space**: Open timeline viewer (or click app icon)
- **ESC**: Close timeline viewer
- **Command + F**: Open text search
- **Click time bubble**: Open date/time picker
- **Scroll/Trackpad**: Scrub through timeline
- **Pinch**: Zoom timeline (1 minute to 60 minutes)

## Development Status

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Unified Playback.app | 🚧 In Progress |
| Recording Service | ✅ Prototype Complete |
| Processing Service | ✅ Prototype Complete |
| Configuration System | 🚧 Specification Complete |
| Date/Time Picker | 🚧 Specification Complete |
| Text Search (OCR) | 🚧 Specification Complete |

## Implementation Plan Format

Each implementation plan follows this structure:

1. **Implementation Checklist**: Actionable tasks with checkboxes, source file references, and implementation details
2. **Technical Details**: Complete specifications, code examples, and implementation patterns
3. **Testing Checklist**: Unit, integration, UI, and performance tests

Example task format:
```markdown
- [ ] Implement menu bar icon with status states
  - Source: `src/Playback/Playback/MenuBar/MenuBarView.swift`
  - States: Recording (red), Paused (gray), Error (red with exclamation)
  - See: "UI Implementation Details" section below
```

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Development Infrastructure ✅
1. ✅ Build system with dev/prod separation
2. ✅ Hot-reloading for development
3. ✅ Pre-commit test hooks
4. ✅ Unit test framework
5. 🚧 File structure reorganization

### Phase 2: Unified App Foundation
1. Single Playback.app with menu bar + timeline
2. LaunchAgent management from within app
3. Settings window (all tabs)
4. Basic configuration system

### Phase 3: Core Recording & Playback
1. Recording service with LaunchAgent
2. Processing service with scheduling
3. Timeline viewer with video playback
4. Date/time picker navigation
5. Enhanced logging and diagnostics

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Text search with OCR
2. Crash notifications with "Open Settings" button
3. Privacy controls (app exclusion)
4. Production build and installer package

## Using These Implementation Plans

1. **Start with [architecture.md](./architecture.md)** to understand the overall system structure
2. **Choose a component** from the implementation plans
3. **Follow the checklist** - each task has source file references and implementation details
4. **Run tests** as specified in the Testing Checklist sections
5. **Check off completed tasks** to track progress
