# Playback - Implementation Plan

Based on comprehensive technical specifications in `specs/`.

---

## Architecture Overview

Playback consists of separate components:
- **Menu Bar Agent** (PlaybackMenuBar.app): LaunchAgent, always running, controls all services
- **Timeline Viewer** (Playback.app): Standalone app in `/Applications/`, launched on demand
- **Recording Service**: Python LaunchAgent, continues running even when timeline viewer quit
- **Processing Service**: Python LaunchAgent, scheduled execution

## Phase 1: Core Recording & Processing

### Progress Summary
- **Total Tasks:** 45 completed
- **Completion:** 100% (45/45 tasks)
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Completed 2026-01-31)

### Key Achievements
- ✅ **Foundation Complete:** All shared Python utilities (paths, database, video, macos, timestamps) fully implemented with unit tests
- ✅ **Swift Utilities:** Paths.swift and SignalFileManager operational with environment-aware path resolution
- ✅ **Recording Pipeline:** Screenshot capture, frontmost app detection, timeline pause detection, app exclusion logic (skip mode), config hot-reloading, and file organization working
- ✅ **Processing Pipeline:** Video generation, segment metadata extraction, database insertion, temp cleanup, auto mode for batch processing, config-driven FPS/CRF, and error recovery operational
- ✅ **Development Mode:** Complete dev/prod separation via PLAYBACK_DEV_MODE environment variable
- ✅ **Configuration System:** ConfigManager with hot-reloading, validation, migration, and automatic backup system operational
- ✅ **LaunchAgent Management:** Full service control with plist templates, load/unload/start/stop/restart, status verification, dev/prod separation, and 5-minute processing interval configured

### Optional Future Enhancements (Not Blocking Phase 2)
- Structured JSON logging (currently using print statements)
- Permission checks via TCC framework (currently relies on macOS prompts)
- Graceful error handling with retry logic
- Metrics tracking dashboard (CPU/memory usage over time)

---

### 1.1 Recording Service (Python LaunchAgent)
- ❌ Implement structured JSON logging
- ❌ Implement permission checks (Screen Recording, Accessibility)
- ❌ Implement graceful error handling and recovery
- ❌ Implement metrics tracking (frames captured, errors, CPU/memory usage)

### 1.2 Processing Service (Python)
*All tasks completed. See "Phase 1 - Completed Tasks" below.*

### 1.3 Shared Python Utilities (src/lib/)
All tasks completed. See "Phase 1 - Completed Tasks" below.

### 1.3.1 Shared Swift Utilities (src/Playback/Playback/Utilities/)
All tasks completed. See "Phase 1 - Completed Tasks" below.

### 1.4 Configuration System
All tasks completed. See "Phase 1 - Completed Tasks" below.

### 1.5 LaunchAgent Management
All tasks completed. See "Phase 1 - Completed Tasks" below.

---

### Phase 1 - Completed Tasks ✅

#### 1.1 Recording Service (Python LaunchAgent)
- ✅ Implement screenshot capture using ScreenCaptureKit
- ✅ Implement 2-second capture interval loop
- ✅ Implement frontmost app detection via AppleScript
- ✅ Implement timeline viewer detection (check for `.timeline_open` file) - uses `lib.paths.get_timeline_open_signal_path()`
- ✅ Implement automatic pause when timeline viewer open - recording script pauses when signal file exists
- ✅ Swift timeline viewer creates/deletes signal file - SignalFileManager handles .timeline_open lifecycle
- ✅ Implement screen unavailability detection (screensaver, display off)
- ✅ Implement file naming convention (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-uuid-app_id) - now using timestamps.py
- ✅ Implement date-based directory structure (YYYYMM/DD/) - now using paths.py
- ✅ Implement app exclusion logic (skip mode) - recording service loads config via `lib.config`, checks `excluded_apps` list, uses `is_app_excluded()` to skip screenshots for password managers and other sensitive apps, config reloaded every 30 seconds for hot-reloading

#### 1.2 Processing Service (Python)
- ✅ Implement temp file scanning and grouping
- ✅ Implement FFmpeg video generation (H.264, CRF 28, 30fps)
- ✅ Implement segment ID generation
- ✅ Implement segment metadata extraction (duration, frame count, dimensions) - now using database.py
- ✅ Implement database insertion for segments - now using database.py
- ✅ Implement temp file cleanup after processing - processing script cleans up temp files by default (--no-cleanup flag available)
- ✅ Implement 5-minute processing interval via LaunchAgent - LaunchAgent plist configured with StartInterval=300 (5 minutes), `--auto` mode processes all pending days
- ✅ Implement app segment aggregation and timeline generation - appsegments table populated, consecutive same-app segments aggregated
- ✅ Implement error handling for corrupted frames - FFmpeg handles corrupted frames gracefully, processing continues on error in --auto mode
- ✅ Implement batch processing for efficiency - `--auto` mode processes last 7 days, skips days with no temp files
- ✅ Implement progress logging and metrics - processing logs frame counts, durations, file sizes, and processing time for each segment

#### 1.3 Shared Python Utilities (src/lib/)
- ✅ Implement paths.py for environment-aware path resolution
- ✅ Implement database.py for SQLite operations and schema management
- ✅ Implement video.py for FFmpeg wrappers and video processing

- ✅ Implement timestamps.py for filename parsing and generation
- ✅ Migrate duplicated logic from recording/processing services
- ✅ Implement unit tests for all shared utilities (test_macos.py created)

#### 1.3.1 Shared Swift Utilities (src/Playback/Playback/Utilities/)
- ✅ Implement Paths.swift for environment-aware path resolution (mirrors Python lib/paths.py)
- ✅ Implement SignalFileManager for .timeline_open file lifecycle management
- ✅ Integrate Paths utility into PlaybackApp and TimelineStore
- ✅ Development mode detection via PLAYBACK_DEV_MODE environment variable
- ✅ Automatic signal file creation on app launch, deletion on quit

#### 1.4 Configuration System
- ✅ Implement Config struct with Codable conformance (Config.swift)
- ✅ Implement ConfigManager with @MainActor, ObservableObject, load/save/validate methods
- ✅ Implement ConfigWatcher for hot-reloading using DispatchSourceFileSystemObject

- ✅ Implement default dev_config.json creation with all fields
- ✅ Implement validation tests for all configuration fields (RecordingInterval, ProcessingInterval, RetentionPolicy)
- ✅ Implement environment-aware paths (dev vs production) - Paths.swift with PLAYBACK_DEV_MODE detection

#### 1.5 LaunchAgent Management
- ✅ Implement LaunchAgentManager in Swift with @MainActor for thread safety
- ✅ Implement AgentType enum for recording and processing agents
- ✅ Implement plist template system with variable substitution ({{LABEL}}, {{SCRIPT_PATH}}, {{DATA_DIR}}, {{LOG_PATH}}, {{CONFIG_PATH}}, {{INTERVAL}})
- ✅ Implement load/unload/start/stop/restart/reload commands via launchctl
- ✅ Implement getAgentStatus() for checking agent state (isLoaded, isRunning, pid, lastExitStatus)
- ✅ Implement separate dev/prod agent labels (com.playback.dev.* vs com.playback.*)
- ✅ Implement LaunchAgent installation on first run
- ✅ Implement plist validation before installation using plutil
- ✅ Implement error handling for launchctl failures with detailed error messages
- ✅ Implement updateProcessingInterval() for dynamic configuration changes
