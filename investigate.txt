a fix for "Thread 1: signal SIGABRT" "An abort signal terminated the process. Such crashes often happen because of an uncaught exception or unrecoverable error or calling the abort() function." error in src/Playback/Playback/Services/LaunchAgentManager.swift:307 when it runs `/bin/launchctl list com.playback.recording` and receives "Could not find service "com.playback.recording" in domain for port". also we want to not allow custom storage location. the only location should be in ~/Library/Application\ Support/Playback (note: not ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.falconer.Playback) for production and dev_data for development
